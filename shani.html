            <h3 class="title" style="font-family: 'Linux Libertine','Georgia','Times',serif; font-size: 29px">History</h3>
            The Shaniwar Wada was a big building for Maratha Empire leaders. It should have been all stone, but part of it became brick due to a complaint. Later, the British attacked, and only the stone base survived. About 1758, almost a thousand people lived there.
            In 1773, the leader Narayanrao was killed on his uncle's orders. People say his ghost asks for help on full moon nights. In 1818, Peshwa Bajirao II surrendered to the British, and a fire in 1828 destroyed most of the palace.
            Bhagwan Swaminarayan visited in 1799 as asked by Bajirao II, mentioned in Haricharitramrutsagar.
