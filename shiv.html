            Shivaneri fort is part of Junnar forest area near to Malshej Ghat. Junnar Taluka, Pune district, Maharashtra, India.
            The construction of Shivneri fort took place during the Yadav era. If we examine the fort's structure along with its surrounding landscape, it resembles the form of a Shivalinga, much like the statue of Lord Shiva. The fort is dedicated to the Goddess Shivai Devi, who is also the Gramdevata (village deity) of Shivneri. The birthplace of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha empire's monarch, is the Shivneri fort. Matoshri Jijamata, Shivaji's mother, named him "Shivaji" in accordance with the Goddess's name, "Shivai."<br><br>
            <h3 class="title" style="font-family: 'Linux Libertine','Georgia','Times',serif; font-size: 29px">History</h3>
            Shivaji maharaj's father gained prominence within the Adil Shah's military, the Sultan of Bijapur. Due to the ongoing conflicts, he grew worried about ensuring the safety of his wife, Jijabai, during her pregnancy. As a result, he relocated his family to the Shivneri fort. Shivneri boasts remarkable defensibility, with steep cliffs on four sides and a robustly constructed fortress.
            <h3><br></h3>Shivaji Maharaj took his first breath within the stronghold on the 19th of February, 1630, and it was within these very walls that he spent his youthful days. Tucked away inside the fortress is a modest shrine dedicated to goddess Shivai Devi, after whom Shivaji was named. It was amidst these castle surroundings that he imbibed the knowledge and training that later fueled his efforts in establishing Hindavi Swaraj (self-governance). The groundwork for his understanding of Swaraj was laid during his early education here. Notably, sculptures of Jijabai and a young Shivaji grace the fortress. The grounds house natural springs known as Ganga-Jamuna, their waters flowing for a significant portion of the year.
